    <p>The <b>AGORA in Asia + 5th Numerical Galaxy Formation Meeting in Korea</b> will be held in Seoul, from May 7 to 10, 2024. This workshop aims to bring together researchers from around the world for open and active discussions on numerical galaxy formation. 
        It will also facilitate discussions about ongoing and future projects within the AGORA high-resolution galaxy simulations comparison project.</p>

    <h4>Numerical Galaxy Formation Workshop (May 7-8)</h4>
    <p>"Numerical Galaxy Formation Meeting" in Korea is an annual meeting by the Korean galaxy simulation community that has grown despite the hardships of COVID-19. We will welcome participants to give talks and extend our invitation to the wider Asian region and beyond. </p>
    
    <h4>AGORA Project Workshop (May 9-10)</h4>
    <p>The 12th Workshop for the AGORA Project will be held. We will have working sessions for ongoing AGORA Papers, and a brainstorming session on Collaboration-wide issues. 
        We may arrange online sessions in the afternoon (e.g., 16:00 KST) to share our progress with the registered remote participants in the US and European time zones. 
        Please feel free to join this workshop if you are interested, especially for Asian astrophysicists who have fewer chances to meet the AGORA project.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Introduce the AGORA project to the Asian region</li>
        <li>Boost ongoing efforts, including papers on "Mergers-I," "Mergers-II," and "Satellite Quenching"</li>
        <li>Identify projects with input from both new and experienced collaboration members</li>
