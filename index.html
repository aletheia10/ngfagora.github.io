    <p>We are pleased to announce that "The 2nd CTP Bosan  Workshop<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>: <b>AGORA in Asia + 5th Numerical Galaxy Formation Meeting in Korea</b>" will be held 
      at Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, Korea, from May 7 to 10, 2024. 
      This workshop aims to bring together researchers from around the world for open and active discussions on numerical galaxy formation. 
      It will also facilitate discussions about ongoing and future efforts within 
      the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/santacruzcomparisonproject/" target="_blank">AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project </a>.</p>
  
    <h4>Registration</h4>
    <p>Registration is now open!  Please fill out the <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=QoAOSjuIWEeWB7BoZIrWxEZa5jE41ixCorOdBpf3JvtUMUlUVlU2OFRXTElOQ1JOS1NRNURVUU4xRi4u" target="_blank">registration form</a> by Feb. 29 
      if you wish to participate in any portion of the Workshop. 
      Please feel free to forward this page to anyone potentially interested, 
      especially to the young numerical astrophysicists who are looking for opportunities to participate in the science comparison in AGORA, 
      and/or to present his/her work at the Numerical Galaxy Formation (NGF) meeting.  
      If you are a member of the AGORA Collaboration and wish to join the Collaboration-wide brainstroming discussion on May 9 (Thu), 
      please register by visiting the link above (registration required to receive a Zoom link).</p>
  
    <h4>Workshop Rationale</h4>
    <p>The first part of the meeting (May 7-8) will be the 5th Numerical Galaxy Formation (NGF) Meeting in Korea.  
      It is an annual meeting of the galaxy simulation community in Korea that has grown despite the hardships of COVID-19 (website of the 4th meeting 
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/snu.ac.kr/2023-darwin-ngf-workshop" target="_blank">here</a>). 
      We welcome workshop participants to give talks, and extend our invitation not only to Korea, but also to the wider Asia region and beyond.
      This will be a great chance to find synergy between the growing numerical astrophysics community in Asia
      and the emerging science opportunities from the new and ongoing AGORA simulations.  
      Between the two communities we hope to find common interests and projects to work on, and to promote efforts on both sides.</p>
    <p>The second part of the meeting (May 9-10) will be the AGORA mini-workshop, taking place between the annual workshops in August.  
      In light of the three AGORA Papers recently posted on the arXiv (Papers IV-VI: “CosmoRun-2”, “Satellites”, “CGM”), 
      we plan to use this mini-workshop to (re)introduce the Project, give a boost to the ongoing efforts (Papers "Mergers-I/II", "Satellite Quenching”, etc), 
      and identify new projects with inputs from new and experienced Collaboration members.  
      (Even the non-Collaboration members are welcome to stay and join the discussion!) 
      This will also serve as a regional workshop, so we will also aim to introduce the AGORA Project to the Asia region, 
      and hear from the local simulation community.
      For this, we will have working sessions for ongoing AGORA Papers, and a brainstorming session on Collaboration-wide issues. 
      We will arrange an online session in the Thursday afternoon, May 9 to share our progress with the registered remote participants in the US and European time zones.</p>
