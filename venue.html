    <h4>From Airport to Hoam Faculty House At SNU</h4>

	    <li>Once you arrive at the <a href="https://www.airport.kr/ap/en/index.do" target="_blank">Incheon International Airport</a> (ICN), 
		the limousine bus is probably the most convenient and inexpensive way to get to the SNU Gwanak campus. 
	    An <a href="https://airportlimousine.co.kr/en/sub/sub01.php?cat_no=51" target="_blank">Airport Limousine Bus (number 6017)</a> 
		    travels from ICN to the Hoam Faculty House (SNU rear gate) 
		    in about 80-100 minutes in normal traffic (80 minutes if boarding at Terminal 1, Gate 6; 100 minutes if boarding at Terminal 2, Gate 27). 
	    Note that the Hoam Faculty House is the last stop of this bus.  
	    Another bus (number 6003) also goes to the SNU main gate, but not only is this gate quite far from the Hoam Faculty House, 
		but the trip also takes longer; so, we do not recommend it. 
	    Limousine bus service runs every day from early morning to late night, with no additional charge for baggages 
	    <a href="https://www.airport.kr/ap/en/tpt/busRouteList.do" target="_blank">(ICN bus routes & where to board)</a>.
	    More information can be found in the <a href="https://hoam.snu.ac.kr/%ec%b0%be%ec%95%84%ec%98%a4%ec%8b%9c%eb%8a%94%ea%b8%b8/" target="_blank">website</a>

            </div>		
	    <li>The taxi fare from ICN to the Hoam Faculty House is around 70,000 won (KRW) depending on traffic conditions.
		For a deluxe taxi (<a href="https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/svc/contents/contentsView.do?vcontsId=140661&menuSn=477" target="_blank">Mobeom Taxi</a>), 
		    the approximate fare will be around 90,000 won (KRW).
	    	If you get on a taxi, show the image on the right to the driver.</li>
	    <li>If you arrive at the <a href="https://www.airport.co.kr/gimpoeng/index.do" target="_blank">Gimpo International Airport</a> (GMP), 
		an <a href="https://airportlimousine.co.kr/en/sub/sub01.php?cat_no=9" target="_blank">Airport Limousine Bus (number 6003)</a> is the only limousine option (boarding at Gate 12), and it will take you to the SNU main gate.  
		    You will likely have to take a taxi or a campus shuttle there to the Hoam Faculty House.</li>

	    <li>The two nearest subway stations around the SNU Gwanak campus are 
		    the "Seoul National Univ. (Gwanak-gu Office) Station" 
		    and the "Nakseongdae Station", both on Subway Line No. 2 (the "Green Line").
	    The former is located 30-40 minutes walk from the SNU main gate, 
		    and the latter is 20 minutes walk from the SNU rear gate. 
	    You may instead take a bus or a campus shuttle to and from these two subway stations to explore Seoul. </li>
