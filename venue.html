    <h4>From Airport to Hoam Faculty House At SNU</h4>
	<ul>

		    <img src="{{ '/assets/img/limousine_map.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Bus Map"  style="margin-left: 20px;" style="margin-top: 10px;">
		</a>
            </div>
	    <li>Once you arrive at the <a href="https://www.airport.kr/ap/en/index.do" target="_blank">Incheon International Airport</a> (ICN), 
		the limousine bus is probably the most convenient and inexpensive way to get to the SNU Gwanak campus. 
	    An <a href="https://airportlimousine.co.kr/en/sub/sub01.php?cat_no=51" target="_blank">Airport Limousine Bus (number 6017)</a> 
		    travels from ICN to the Hoam Faculty House 
		    in about 80-100 minutes in normal traffic (80 minutes if boarding at Terminal 1, Gate 6; 100 minutes if boarding at Terminal 2, Gate 27). 
	    Note that the Hoam Faculty House is the last stop of this bus, and the bus fare is 17,000 won (KRW, as of Jan. 2024; 1 USD ~ 1,300 KRW).  
	    Another bus (number 6003) also goes to the SNU main gate, but not only is this gate quite far from the Hoam Faculty House, 
		but the trip also takes longer; so, we do not recommend it. 
	    Limousine bus service runs every day from early morning to late night, with no additional charge for baggages 
	    <a href="https://www.airport.kr/ap/en/tpt/busRouteList.do" target="_blank">(ICN bus routes & where to board)</a>.
	    More information can be found in the <a href="https://hoam.snu.ac.kr/%ec%b0%be%ec%95%84%ec%98%a4%ec%8b%9c%eb%8a%94%ea%b8%b8/" target="_blank">website</a>
		    of the Hoam Faculty House.</li>

		</a>
            </div>		
	    <li>The taxi fare from ICN to the Hoam Faculty House is around 70,000 won (KRW) depending on traffic conditions.
		For a deluxe taxi (<a href="https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/svc/contents/contentsView.do?vcontsId=140661&menuSn=477" target="_blank">Mobeom Taxi</a>), 
		    the approximate fare will be around 90,000 won (KRW).
	    	If you get on a taxi, show the first sentence in the image on the right to the driver.
	    	All taxis in Korea -- and nearly all stores/restaurants/hotels -- accept credit cards, but prepare some cash in KRW 
	    		in case your credit card doesn't work.  Tips are not necessary as there is no tipping culture in Korea.</li>
	    <li>If you arrive at the <a href="https://www.airport.co.kr/gimpoeng/index.do" target="_blank">Gimpo International Airport</a> (GMP), 
		an <a href="https://airportlimousine.co.kr/en/sub/sub01.php?cat_no=9" target="_blank">Airport Limousine Bus (number 6003)</a> is the only limousine option (boarding at Gate 12), and it will take you to the SNU main gate.  
		    You will likely have to take a taxi or a campus shuttle there to the Hoam Faculty House.</li>

	    <li>The two nearest subway stations around the SNU Gwanak campus are 
		    the "Seoul National Univ. (Gwanak-gu Office) Station" 
		    and the "Nakseongdae Station", both on Subway Line No. 2 (the "Green Line").
	    The former is located 30-40 minutes walk from the SNU main gate, 
		    and the latter is 20 minutes walk from the SNU rear gate that is close to the Hoam Faculty House. 
	    You may instead take a bus or a campus shuttle to and from these two subway stations to explore Seoul. </li>
